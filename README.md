# E-Cell Web-Team Recruitment Task

## Project Overview

This project is a front-end website consisting of two pages: a Home Page and a Second Page. The design for the Home Page is provided in a Figma design file, and the Second Page is to be designed by the developer.

## Page 1: Home Page

### Navigation Bar

- The navigation bar is located at the top of the Home Page and includes three options: 'Home', 'Grid', and 'LinkedIn'.
- Clicking 'Home' redirects the user to the Second Page.
- Clicking 'Grid' redirects the user back to the Home Page.
- Clicking 'LinkedIn' redirects the user to the developer's LinkedIn profile.

### Page Layout

The Home Page's body is divided into three rectangular sections:

1. **First Section**
   - Contains HTML elements.

2. **Second Section**
   - Contains a Logo of E-cell designed to fill its container.

3. **Third Section**
   - Features a 3x3 grid with 9 blue squares.
   - Clicking on a square changes its color to red.
   - An advanced feature is implemented where clicking the last square (bottom-right) changes all square colors back to blue in the sequence of their original clicks.

## Page 2: Second Page

1. This page includes the developer's picture, name, registration number, and a button that redirects users to the developer's Instagram handle.
2. The design of this page is to be created by the developer.
